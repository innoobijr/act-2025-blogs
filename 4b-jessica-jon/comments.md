* The discussion on graded monads and adjunction are good. And in my opinion coherent. 
* However, there is not a forceful enough motivation for the discussion about them for the applied problem your group is solving for. We recommend finding some way to sync where necessary the work of your group.
* The last section on applications I feel to occupy more space on the blog and feels rushed. I'd recommend rebalancing the blog post so there is more time spent on the applicaiton section and less on the theory and descriptions provided in the prior sections.
