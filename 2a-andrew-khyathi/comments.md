# Drew's Comments

First off, great compelling start to the intro. The whole intro itself may be a little long, but I only say that because I'm assuming that most readers of the n category cafe are already familiar with monads. I'm just going off of assumption here. If we're looking to cut down the length of the blog post, a good place to start might be to cut some of the monad examples and link to another blog post that explains them.

In general, good solid tutorial post. This is similar to the one my group wrote for Markov categories. It got lots of comments, so hopefully yours will as well!

First steps: Comb the post for typos (I noticed some myself, marked below), and provide us with the markdown file and all images. Upload to your folder in your branch on this github repo. Then we need to do work to ensure that it formats correctly on the website. This includes uploading images to the website, and changing all relative image links into hard links pointing to image location. You don't have very many equations, so your work should be minimal.

Typos:

* Bottom of page six: chnage "function J from C to K" to "functor J from C to K"
* Page 9: "a mapping on objects" is written twice. Roll the equation in the first bullet into the line above.
