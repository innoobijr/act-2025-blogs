First off, great blog post! I found many parts of this to be approachable and easy enough to understand. For reference, I'm a bit familiar with lenses with respect to dynamical systems, but have almost no background in logic or error analysis. So thanks for the teaser on the subject.

I think the big piece of feedback I have here is the intro. We're looking to captivate readers and suck them in, many of whom are completely unfamiliar with the subject, but who also do have some category theory knowledge. This is just my personal style, but I always like to go with super concrete examples. Here's my thought, but feel free to do something else: provide two examples, one for linear logic, and one for error analysis. The `add` example was great for the examle BEAN program. Maybe put that in the intro, along with a concrete example of a judgment in linear logic. Then maybe you could go through the process of building a lens out of each of these examples. This would highlight the similarities between the two constructions, teasing at a relationship between dialectica categories and Bel. Then that would set up the motivation to learn more about the two categories in depth for the rest of the blog post.

What do y'all think?
