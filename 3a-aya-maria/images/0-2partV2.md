I need to define the terminal object, but it is fine if you think in this picture, when to one object go from the other objects one arrow, for example, in the opposite sense all the rays of light goes out from the sun, to each particle in the space one for each particle that encounters in its way through the vacuum. In our case, the terminal object receives for each object in our universe one arrow of light.
Then in the context of math, you have from the any object one arrow to the terminal object. What identifies an a terminal object? For example in the category where the objects are simple graphs and the morphisms are the conceptual morphisms that we called **SiGrphs**, and in the category where the objects are conceptual graphs and the morphisms are strict morphisms **SiStGrphs**, we can see that the terminal objects are distinct:
- In one case, the terminal object is only a one vertex, because we can collapse any graph to one vertex, for example ... in this graph all te vertices can be send to the one vertex, and to preserve incidence we are enagaged to send all the edges in that vertex.
- In the second case, we dont send edges into vertices then we need a loop, and our terminal object allows us to colapse all the vertices in one point, and all the edges in the one loop. Then we respec the strict graph homomorphism.
