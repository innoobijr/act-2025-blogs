Good introduction to quantum computing, and the examples are nice. The introduction should be strong and enticing, in order to grab the reader's attention: start with a question or something intriguing, and outline the basics of why you're writing and the problem you're trying to solve.

Also, please provide the markdown file and push it to this repo. We need to make sure the markdown is compatible with the blog's special flavor of markdown+itex.

The final section also needs work. In line with the previous sections, it will help to build out a specific example of constructing superoperators as a relative monad. It also needs to be rounded out with a concise conclusion that again intrigues the reader and gives them a sense of accomplishment for getting through your blog post.
